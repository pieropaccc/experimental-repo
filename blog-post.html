            <h3>How To Bake A Potato:</h3>
            Here is my tried and true best method for how to make baked potatoes in the oven…
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oven to 450°F. Yep, you read the temperature right. The oven needs to be extra hot, so that the potato skins will crisp up quickly.</li>
                <li>Prepare your baking sheet.  If you happen to own a wire cooling rack, I highly recommend placing one on top of a baking sheet, so that the potatoes can cook evenly on all sides</li>
                <li>Poke your potato all over with a fork.  Because no one wants to deal with exploding potatoes.</li>
                <li>First bake. My best advice for how long to bake a potato — in two rounds! For the first round, bake for about 25 minutes, until the skin starts to feel dry and slightly wrinkly.</li>
            </ol>
